congress.gov api: https://api.congress.gov/sign-up/
api key (acquired for XXXXXXXXX@XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, only for my use apparently): XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
congress.gov api help page: https://www.congress.gov/help/using-data-offsite
according to https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov:
rate limit for requests is 1000/hr
api returns first 20 results, up to 250, and then no more
congress.gov github documentation: https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/tree/main/Documentation
committee report endpoint: https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/api.congress.gov/blob/main/Documentation/CommitteeReportEndpoint.md
committee report request format from https://api.congress.gov/#/committee-report/committee_reports:
https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee-report/[CONGRESS NUMBER]/hrpt?format=json&offset=0&limit=250&api_key=[INSERT_KEY]
hrpt=house report, as opposed to srpt=senate report or erpt=executive report
offset can be used to get the next 250 results after the first 250
it appears that this specific endpoint simply returns information about committee reports available
however, for each item returned by the request, it seems possible to plainly request each one, individually
the data provided may be used in the following format to make a raw text request for each committee report:
https://www.congress.gov/[CONGRESS NUMBER]/crpt/hrpt[REPORT NUMBER]/generated/CRPT-[CONGRESS NUMBER]hrpt[REPORT NUMBER].htm
curl requests to download that text are probably not rate limited by the API, because they do not use it
